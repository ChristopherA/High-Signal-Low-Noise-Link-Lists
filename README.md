# @ChristopherA’s High-Signal, Low Noise Links Lists      
A series of lists of opinionated, high-signal but low-noise links on topics I care about.

> If you like my advocacy, my point-of-view, my writing, my travel, my talks, and my work with organizations such as [Blockchain Commons](https://www.BlockchainCommons.com), [Rebooting the Web of Trust](https://www.WebOfTrust.info) and the [W3C Credentials CG](https://w3c-ccg.github.io), I invite you to sponsor me by becoming a monthly patron on my [GitHub Sponsor Page](https://github.com/sponsors/ChristopherA) for as little as $5 a month, as they are matching the first $5,000!
>
> Alternatively can also support my efforts by sponsoring [Blockchain Commons](https://www.BlockchainCommons.com) and our vision of the open web via a monthly [GitHub Sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons) or with Bitcoin via our BTCPay contribution page. [Bitcoin contribution](https://btcpay.blockchaincommons.com).
>
>But please don’t think of this as a transaction. It’s an opportunity to advance the open web, digital civil liberties and human rights together. You get to plug into my various projects, and hopefully will find a way to actively contribute to the digital commons yourself. Let’s collaborate!
